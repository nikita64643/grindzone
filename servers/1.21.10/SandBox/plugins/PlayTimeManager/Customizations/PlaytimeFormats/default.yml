#    WARNING: This is a default template that gets overwritten after each plugin reload.
#    Copy this file or create your own custom format definitions to preserve changes.

# OVERVIEW:
# This file defines custom time display formats that can be referenced throughout the plugin
# using %PLAYTIME:format-name% syntax in configuration messages, where format-name is the name of the related format file.
# For example, to use the default format you would write %PLAYTIME:default% or simply %PLAYTIME% (default is used when format is omitted).

# HOW IT WORKS:
# Create a new file under 'Customization/PlaytimeFormats' with your desired format name, then define text
# labels for time units (years, days, hours, minutes, seconds) and create a formatting string
# that combines all units you need. You can then reference your format using %PLAYTIME:file-name% in plugin
# messages like "Your playtime is %PLAYTIME:short%" or "Player time: %PLAYTIME:compact%".

# FORMATTING SYSTEM:
# Use %y%, %mo%, %w%, %d%, %h%, %m%, %s% as time value placeholders (these cannot be modified) and
# {years}, {months}, {weeks}, {days}, {hours}, {minutes}, {seconds} for unit labels. Zero values are automatically
# hidden (e.g., 0 years won't display), and singular/plural forms are automatically selected
# based on the time value.

# CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
# You can omit time units you don't need from the formatting field
# and use different separators like commas, spaces, or custom text to create
# the exact display style you want.

years-singular: "y"
years-plural: "y"
months-singular: "mo"
months-plural: "mo"
weeks-singular: "w"
weeks-plural: "w"
days-singular: "d"
days-plural: "d"
hours-singular: "h"
hours-plural: "h"
minutes-singular: "m"
minutes-plural: "m"
seconds-singular: "s"
seconds-plural: "s"
formatting: "%y%{years}, %d%{days}, %h%{hours}, %m%{minutes}, %s%{seconds}"

# DISTRIBUTE REMOVED TIME:
# Controls whether time from omitted units in the formatting field gets redistributed to displayed units.
# When true: omitted larger time units are converted and added to the next smallest displayed unit.
# When false: omitted time units are simply hidden without redistribution.
#
# Example with time of 1d, 12h, 1m and formatting "%h%{hours}, %m%{minutes}":
# - If true: displays "36h, 1m" (1 day converted to 24 hours, added to 12h = 36h)
# - If false: displays "12h, 1m" (1 day is hidden, only original 12h shown)
